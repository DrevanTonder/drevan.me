			<p>Hey 👋,</p>

			<p>My name is Andre van Tonder, aka “drevan”. I’m a web developer ⚒️ and designer 🎨 passionate about making beautifully crafted web experiences 🖼️.</p>

			<p>When I’m not problem solving for the web, you can find me learning photography 📸, at church ⛪, on a road-trip adventure 🌋, or something crazy with friends and family.
			</p>

			<p>Wishing you the most awesome day,
				Andre 🥳
